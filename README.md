# GNS3 Copilot UI

GNS3 Copilot UI is the evolved, professional-grade interface for the GNS3 Copilot project. By moving from Streamlit to a decoupled **React + FastAPI** architecture, this tool provides a seamless, high-performance experience for network engineers to interact with GNS3 topologies using Generative AI.

## 🚀 Vision
To transform the way network engineers interact with complex environments. Instead of manual CLI configuration and static diagrams, GNS3 Copilot UI allows you to talk to your network, visualize state changes in real-time, and let AI handle the documentation.

## ✨ Key Features
- **AI-Native Chat Interface**: Powered by **Ant Design X**, offering streaming responses, reasoning steps, and direct command execution.
- **Dynamic Topology Visualization**: Built with **React Flow** to render GNS3 projects as interactive graphs. Nodes reflect real-time status (Started/Stopped) and support AI-driven highlighting.
- **Instant Engineering Notes**: Automated capture of configuration changes and analysis results into a structured "Live Note" module.
- **Asynchronous Backend**: A high-performance **FastAPI** server managing LangChain agents and GNS3 REST API communications.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, Ant Design X, React Flow.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.10+), LangChain/LangGraph, GNS3-Python.
- **State Management**: Zustand.
